Prism is a lightweight, robust, and elegant syntax highlighting library. It's a spin-off project from [Dabblet](https://dabblet.com/).

You can learn more on [prismjs.com](https://prismjs.com/).

### **Important Notice**

We are currently working on [Prism v2](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/discussions/3531) and will only accept security-relevant PRs for the time being.

Once work on Prism v2 is sufficiently advanced, we will accept PRs again. This will be announced on our [Discussion](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/discussions) page and mentioned in the [roadmap discussion](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/discussions/3531).

<summary>Prism v1 contributing notes</summary>

Prism depends on community contributions to expand and cover a wider array of use cases. If you like it, consider giving back by sending a pull request. Here are a few tips:

-   Read the [documentation](https://prismjs.com/extending.html). Prism was designed to be extensible.
-   Do not edit `prism.js`, it’s just the version of Prism used by the Prism website and is built automatically. Limit your changes to the unminified files in the `components/` folder. `prism.js` and all minified files are generated by our build system (see below).
-   Use `npm ci` to install Prism's dependencies. Do not use `npm install` because it will cause non-deterministic builds.
-   The build system uses [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) to minify the files and build `prism.js`. With all of Prism's dependencies installed, you just need to run the command `npm run build`.
-   Please follow the code conventions used in the files already. For example, I use [tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment](http://lea.verou.me/2012/01/why-tabs-are-clearly-superior/). Opening braces are on the same line, closing braces on their own line regardless of construct. There is a space before the opening brace. etc etc.
-   Please try to err towards more smaller PRs rather than a few huge PRs. If a PR includes changes that I want to merge and also changes that I don't, handling it becomes difficult.
-   My time is very limited these days, so it might take a long time to review bigger PRs (small ones are usually merged very quickly), especially those modifying the Prism Core. This doesn't mean your PR is rejected.
-   If you contribute a new language definition, you will be responsible for handling bug reports about that language definition.
-   If you [add a new language definition](https://prismjs.com/extending.html#creating-a-new-language-definition) or plugin, you need to add it to `components.json` as well and rebuild Prism by running `npm run build`, so that it becomes available to the download build page. For new languages, please also add a few [tests](https://prismjs.com/test-suite.html) and an example in the `examples/` folder.
-   Go to [prism-themes](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes) if you want to add a new theme.

Thank you so much for contributing!!

## Customizing Prism

To customize the Prism you will need to customize the prism.js file. This requires cloning our Forked repository (it contains some extra languages and styling tweaks) from: [https://github.com/getgrav/prism](https://github.com/getgrav/prism)

Then run the following commands:

```
npm run build
npm run start
```

The second command starts a built-in webserver. Locate the prism.js file included in this plugin, and view the source, Find the build URL and paste that into your browser. It should look something like:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/download.html#themes=prism&languages=markup+css+clike+javascript+apacheconf+bash+bbcode+c+csharp+cpp+css-extras+diff+docker+git+go+ini+java+json+json5+less+makefile+markdown+markup-templating+nginx+powershell+python+regex+ruby+rust+sass+scss+sql+systemd+twig+yaml&plugins=line-highlight+line-numbers+command-line+toolbar+copy-to-clipboard
```

This pre-configures the languages, plugins, etc.

Make your changes, including adding additional languages, plugins etc. Then click DOWNLOAD JS and DOWNLOAD CSS buttons and upload your copies to a safe location, e.g. /user/data/prims-highlight/.

You can then edit the configuration of the prism-highlight plugin and point the custom.js_location and custom.css_location options to the custom file locations (default is already user://data/prismjs folder).

Modify the JS function `navigator.clipboard.writeText` by adding `.replace(/^[\$\s\#\$]{1,4}/gm, '')` after `e.getText()`

```js
...function(e,o){e.addEventListener("click",(function(){!function(e){navigator.clipboard?navigator.clipboard.writeText(e.getText().replace(/^[\$\s\#\$]{1,4}/gm, '')).then(e.success,(function(){t(e)})):t(e)}(o)}))}(c,{getText:function(){return...
```
